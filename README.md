# PVM

PVM is a turing complete esoteric interpreted programming language similar to Assembly implemented in Python. It's a hobby project in active development.

Below is an example of PVM's usage.

## How to install

### Arch Linux or Arch-Based Linux Distributions
You can simply use an AUR helper to install pvm-git with commands like `yay -S pvm-git` or `paru -S pvm-git`.

## Features

### Turing Complete
Yes, you can literally make anything in this language with enough time and dedication.

### Easy To Understand
I explicitly designed the syntax to be as understandable as possible.

### Great Way To Be Creative
You know what they say, limitations make creativity. While this language is turing complete, it doesn't have that many built-in features, which leads users to reinvent the function they would've otherwise taken for granted.

## Example Snippet

Here's a small snippet of a "Hello, world!" program in PVM.

```
LOAD REG1 "Hello, world!"
OUT REG1
HLT
```

## ❗❗ WARNING ❗❗

PVM-GIT is currently only on the AUR. However, I'll try to get it to as many distros as possible. These source files are the files that the PVM bootstrapper uses, the PVM bootstrapper source is currently not available for viewing, but I plan to add it to GitHub too.
